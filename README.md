> My name is August. And this is my python learning journey which start from the projecteuler.net problem sets. Which i will updating regularly as i discover new ideas and ways to solve problems.

## For simplicity, all the current files are written in Python 3.9

- To run the file, head to your project file location example/projecteuler.net/filename/py
- Open command prompt in the current folder and type:
- ## python filename.py
> Assuming you already have python install in your machine, this should execute the file
> If you do not have python installed follow the link (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
> Download and follow prompt to run install.
