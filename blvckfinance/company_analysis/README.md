Python for Finance â€“ Company Due Diligence
As a heads up, our Python script will have multiple functions. To make the article easy to follow, I will share the code at the end of the article and provide a short description for each of the functions during the post. To make things more clear, I will link to some of my other posts on Python for Finance whenever is applicable to share additional details.

If you run the code and you get some error, check that you have installed in your machine all required libraries. I will mention in each of the sections which Python libraries we need to install.

Please note that this post is not offering any financial advise. I am not a financial advisor and I do not intend to share financial advises or recommendations in my posts. In addition, the code provided in this post may not be free of errors. So perform your own diligence before relying on it.
